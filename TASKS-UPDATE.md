Note: I am uploading the code before I feel ready to but I will be traveling all day tommarrow and want every to have chance to see it. Will be back at it in a day or two. Here are the area's that are incomplete at the moment.

* Account settings page (src/pages/UserSettings.js) - I slapped this page together but I am open to a complete re-build. I think it looks terrible at the moment but if someone wants to keep the layout I am up for a complete re-build.
* Responsiveness - I have not added any Responsiveness to the site yet but will get to that once all page layouts are complete
* Discussions Page (src/pages/Discussion.js) - Page design is mostly complete but the code is clunky. Needed a re-build to clean things up and keep format
* Post Comments - Need to create a comment component for posts and discussions. Layout is 30% of the way there but needs work
* CSS - I have been working with a few people on the UI kit along with adding styling to the website. At some point will will need to go back through and separate all the css code and clean up the formatting
