# Status

Note: I am uploading the code before I feel ready but I will be traveling all day tommarrow (4/1) and want everyone to have a chance to see it. Will be back at it in a day or two. Here are the area's that are incomplete at the moment.

* Account settings page (src/pages/UserSettings.js) - I slapped this page together but I am open to a complete re-build. I think it looks terrible at the moment but if someone wants to keep the layout I am up for a complete re-build.
* Responsiveness - I have not added any Responsiveness to the site yet but will get to that once all page layouts are complete -Asigned to:DENNIS
* Discussions Page (src/pages/Discussion.js) - Page design is mostly complete but the code is clunky. Needed a re-build to clean things up and keep format
* Post Comments - Need to create a comment component for posts and discussions. Layout is 30% of the way there but needs work
* CSS - I have been working with a few people on the UI kit along with adding styling to the website. At some point we will need to go back through and separate all the CSS code and clean up the formatting


# Pages & Components Needed:
* Users Search page - Find all users on platform by name, username & interests
* Topic search page - Search topics and add them to your list of interests
* Article page
* Header Bar - Asigned to:DENNIS
* Notifications dropdown option

# Action Plan

At this point it looks like I'll need another day or two to to get the front end finished up. Once thats done I will spend a few days building out the database and API so we can start implementing both sides.
